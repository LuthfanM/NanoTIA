This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Introduction

Create a simple Tech in Asia website called “nanoTIA” using React, Redux, and Bootstrap. Your
Git repository has to be on GitHub, make it a private repository and invite me (@opam22) as
collaborator.

You only need to show two pages:
● Front Page
○ Shows a list of posts with title and a snippet of the post content.
○ Example: ​https://id.techinasia.com/category/startups
○ API Endpoint:
https://id.techinasia.com/wp-json/techinasia/3.0/categories/startups/posts?page=1&per_page=5

● Single Post Page
○ Upon clicking on the post title on the front page, it will bring you to the single post
page.
○ Example: ​https://id.techinasia.com/cashlez-fabelio-fitur-baru-bayar-furnitur
○ API Endpoint:
https://id.techinasia.com/wp-json/techinasia/3.0/posts/cashlez-fabelio-fitur-baru-bayar-furnitur

You don’t need to design any layout or elements, you can use the default Bootstrap theme. We
need you to use Redux for managing the state.
